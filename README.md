# Manchester University's Anime Society's Website
This is the Official MUAS Website repository, designed for all MUAS needs.

The website is designed to help give computer science students a side project to work on, centralise and store information such as events, photos (with permission of course) and newsletters as well as anything else. This readme.md and the project itself should evolve over its lifetime so more things will be added in the future. The website isn't necessary but it'd be cool to have one so why not?
